# Unix Timestamp Calculator

A simple Python script that calculates Unix timestamps for a specified time period (in minutes). This script is useful for converting a time period into Unix timestamps and can be used in scenarios where time-based calculations are needed.

## Features

- Calculates Unix timestamps for the current time (`until_time`) and a previous time period (`from_time`).
- The time period is specified in minutes using a command-line argument.

## Requirements

- Python 3.x
- The `calendar` and `datetime` modules are standard in Python, so no additional packages are needed.

## Installation

1. Clone the repository:

   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/purpleax/unix-timestamp-calculator.git
   cd unix-timestamp-calculator


Usage: python timestamp_calculator.py <minutes>
